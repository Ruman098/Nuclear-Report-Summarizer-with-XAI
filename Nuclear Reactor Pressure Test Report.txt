Nuclear Reactor Pressure Test Report
Date: 2025-06-16

1. Introduction
The purpose of this test is to evaluate the structural integrity and pressure containment capability of the reactor coolant system under simulated operating conditions.

2. Test Setup
- Reactor Type: Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)
- Test Medium: Deionized Water
- Initial Pressure: 15.5 MPa
- Temperature: 290Â°C
- Instrumentation: Pressure transducers at inlet, outlet, and safety valve locations

3. Procedure
1. Incrementally increase pressure in 1.0 MPa steps.
2. Hold at each pressure level for 10 minutes, monitoring for leaks or pressure decay.
3. Record readings from transducers every 30 seconds.
4. After reaching maximum test pressure (16.5 MPa), gradually decrease pressure to nominal operating level.

4. Results
| Pressure (MPa) | Pressure Decay (kPa over 10 min) | Leak Observed | Comments               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 15.5           | 2                                 | No            | Stable                 |
| 16.0           | 5                                 | No            | Acceptable decay rate  |
| 16.5           | 10                                | No            | Within safety margins  |

5. Conclusion
The reactor coolant system maintained pressure within acceptable decay limits and showed no leakage up to 16.5 MPa. The system complies with design specifications.

6. Recommendations
- Schedule next pressure test in 12 months.
- Inspect all transducers for calibration.
- Review safety valve performance under dynamic conditions.
